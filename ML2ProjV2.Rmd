UNFORTUNATELY: GOOGLE HAS bLOCKED US SO WE HAD TO USE THE CSV THAT WE WERE SAVING TO MAKE THIS a repeatable proccess 
```{r setup, echo=TRUE}

library(readr)
library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(lubridate)

df <- read_csv("combined_fashion_trends_fixed.csv")
head(df)

head(df)

df_wide <- df %>%
  select(date, keyword, hits) %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = keyword, values_from = hits)

df_wide$date <- as.Date(df_wide$date)

ts_data <- ts(df_wide[,-1],
              start = c(year(min(df_wide$date)), month(min(df_wide$date))),
              frequency = 52)  

#time series plotted
plot(ts_data, main = "Google Trends Time Series for Fashion Keywords")

decomposed <- decompose(ts_data[, "turtleneck sweater"], type = "multiplicative")
plot(decomposed)
title(main ="decomposed plot for turtleneck sweater" )

decomposed <- decompose(ts_data[, "shearling slippers"], type = "multiplicative")
plot(decomposed)
title(main = "decomposed plot for shearling slippers")

decomposed <- decompose(ts_data[, "long-sleeve bodysuit"], type = "multiplicative")
plot(decomposed)
title(main = "decomposed plot for long-sleeve bodysuit")

decomposed <- decompose(ts_data[, "poncho cape"], type = "multiplicative")
plot(decomposed)
title(main = "decomposed plot for poncho cape")

```
